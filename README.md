# Gemini API Python Examples

This project contains examples of how to use the Google Gemini API with Python to perform various tasks such as generating text from images and text inputs, asking questions, and initiating chat sessions. The examples demonstrate the capabilities of the Gemini API in creating AI-driven content.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, you'll need to install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have a Google API key configured as an environment variable named GOOGLE_API_KEY to authenticate your requests to the Gemini API.

## Examples

- `hi_gemini_omni.py`: Demonstrates how Gemini 1.5 models can handle multimodal inputs.
- `hi_gemini_chat.py`: Demonstrates chat conversations because they come with history support.
- `hi_gemini_ask.py`: Shows how to ask a question and receive an answer from the Gemini model.
- `hi_gemini.py`: Check out how to count tokens in Gemini
